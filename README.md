## About

This script will: 

 1. download the Ubuntu 12.04 alternate server, 32bit iso
 2. ... do some magic to turn it into a vagrant box file
 3. output package.box 

## Usage

    ./build.sh

This should do everything you need. 

### Keith's notes

Changed to work on an Ubuntu host, to create a 32bit image, and localized for the US.
